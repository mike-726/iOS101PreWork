### App Idea

Iâ€™d like to build a productivity app called "FocusFlow" that combines task management with mindfulness techniques. Features would include customizable to-do lists, Pomodoro timers, and guided meditation sessions to help users stay focused and reduce stress. Additionally, it would offer progress tracking and motivational insights to encourage consistent productivity habits.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1. I had issues with the simulator that after clicking "Run" button, I didn't see the simulator shows up. Later I found that it's because I was in the fullscreen mode so that I wouldn't see the simulator.
